# Host compiler for Anchor 0.30.1 + Solana 1.18.x.
# The on-chain BPF compiler is bundled with Solana Platform Tools and uses
# its own rustc. This file pins the HOST compiler used by `anchor build`
# and `cargo build-sbf` for metadata resolution.
#
# Requires 1.85+ for edition2024 support in transitive deps.
